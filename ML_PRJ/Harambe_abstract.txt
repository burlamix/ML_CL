It's the journey that matters, not the destination. In this report we briefly describe our own journey up to the participation in the ML cup as part of the machine learning course given at Pisa University. In order to get there we developed a lightweight library to create, train and validate neural networks models. Furthermore we assessed the correctness of our implementation by running several benchmarks on standardized tasks as well as by meticulously comparing our results with those obtained using a well-known deep learning library.
